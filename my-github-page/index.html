        <h2>Personal Information</h2>
        <p>
            Outside of work, I love traveling the world to teach my kids about diversity and expose them to different cultures. 
            I enjoy watching my son play basketball and cheering him on from the sidelines. My wife and I also enjoy working out 
            together at F45, where we love the challenge of the high-energy team workouts. I also enjoy spending time with my dog, 
            Google, who earned his name because my kids thought it would be funny that every time we said 'Hey Google,' all the 
            Google Home devices would trigger.
